## Refactoring
  
Fork my repo (work in your own repository, dont send me any pull requests)  
https://github.com/kaybeeM/FowlerFC  
This is the end of the first refactoring step according to Fowler.  
(You need to first create a Java Project in your favorite IDE,  
you can also just copy the four classes)  
Follow the steps described in Chapter 1 linked below (you need to read it)  
The code I gave you gets you up to the middle of page 21 in the pdf.  
You can earn your e-Porfolio by writing a test suite for this project  
  
Work in teams of 2. Create branches for each single refactoring change that you make. Ie. Commit, push and merge after every single refactoring step!  
For example: Team member 1 creates first change (you can pair program) Team member 2 does next change, etc...  
Use the refactoring facilities that your IDE offers. If you dont know them, use this opportunity to get to know them.  
You could try using Gerrit for codechecking each step before merging with master.  
You can try first writing test code before refactoring so that you can prove that your refactoring did not alter the code functionality.  
Handin: Each team has to show a link to their final git where I can check all the steps for refactoring.  
  
When you are done submit by adding your   
Link, Name 1, Name 2 to the google docs link below.   
You will need this to graduate from the course.
